/* Systick values are in milliseconds, accessing the value is faster. As a result
 * we have a random invisible delay of less than a millisecond whenever we use
 * systicks. This can result in a situation where we access the systick just before it changes:
 *  -> Access at 0,99ms gives systick 0ms
 *  -> Access at 1.01ms gives systick 1ms
 *  -> systick difference of 1ms, even though only 0.02 ms passed
 * To prevent this, we generally apply a correction of -1 to any systick difference.
 * In wait() this is done by using '<=' instead of '<'
 * In timeDiff() the subtraction is carried out on the result.
 * That subtraction is prevented from underflowing to UINT32_MAX, returning 0 in
 * that case (Saturated subtraction).
